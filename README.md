### **City-Level Analysis**
- **New York City**: Dominates with **$600K** in total sales, representing **10%** of overall sales, with a profit of **$150K**. This high-performance city should serve as a model for other locations.

2. **Boost Underperforming Regions**: Invest in marketing campaigns targeting the **Central** and **South** regions. A potential strategy is offering region-specific discounts or opening pop-up stores to drive traffic.

3. **Expand Best-Selling Products**: Prioritize high-profit products such as the **Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier**. Increase promotions for similar high-margin items to maximize revenue.

4. **Address Underperforming Branches**: Investigate why branches like **Philadelphia** and **Houston** are underperforming, and develop localized strategies to overcome operational challenges, such as cost optimization or new sales strategies.

5. **Optimize Discounting Strategies**: Reassess current discount policies, especially in the **Furniture** category, where heavy discounts seem to negatively impact profit margins. More targeted promotions could help balance profitability.
